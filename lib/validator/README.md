=============

Validator is made to validate fields, array, and objects
Return true or an errorstring

# customizing validator 
export Field and override prototype
it will do for now

To sanitize data, write your own library.
This library shall accept at least validated values of validator
(maybe more).
Consider sanitizing lib as a casting library.
